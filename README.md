Event Management System

This is a simple web application for managing events. It allows users to add, update, and delete events and view a list of upcoming events.

Features

User authentication and authorization
Event creation, updating, and deletion
Event listing and filtering by date
User-friendly interface with navigation and form validation
Getting Started
To use this application, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. You can then navigate the application using the links in the navigation bar.

Login Credentials

The application comes with three pre-defined users:

admin: password
user1: password1
user2: password2
You can use these credentials to log in and test the application.

Technical Details

This application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and interactive user interface. It also uses local storage to store user authentication information. We are working on a backend database that stores user info instead of hardcoded ones and creating a database for storing event info as well.
